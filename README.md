Code is used to create a folder 'Harry Potter' with 8 subfolders each representing a separate film.

Each subfolder also contains subfolders (A-Z) with .txt files inside. Name of the .txt corresponds to the name of award the film won/was nominated for.

And finally, each .txt file contains all the Nominations of the specified Award (in general, not by the film).

To create the master folder 'Harry Potter': run 'hairy_potter.py' file, and you are good to go.

If the folder 'Harry Potter' is already created or if you just want to rerun the code, simply delete the 'Harry Potter' folder and run the 'hairy_potter.py' file again.

Thank you for your attention and have a good one!
